Personal Web under development (Jun/10/2025)

About Me 
======

I am passionate about bridging the gap between **bioinformatics**, **applied mathematics**, and **algorithms**, and I am actively exploring opportunities at their intersection.

My academic background is in **Applied Math/Statistics** and **Computer Science**, and I have trained in **Bioinformatics** at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

This journey began in 2024 when, as an applied math student, I sought a research area that could fully leverage my interdisciplinary strengths. I was introduced to a project at the **Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics (CFCE)**, focusing on clustering cell types using scATAC-seq data—a process strikingly similar to a final project I completed in a high-dimensional statistics course with Prof. Mauro Maggioni at Hopkins.

Through this experience, I came to appreciate the critical role of mathematical thinking in biomedical research—and the importance of making complex, often counterintuitive, high-dimensional concepts accessible to collaborators from diverse fields.
