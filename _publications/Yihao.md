abstract: 'Loss of METTL3 stimulates mammary epithelial proliferation and reprograms gene expression in an m6A methyltransferase-dependent manner. Single-cell analysis in breast organoids revealed disruption of mammary hierarchy due to aberrant luminal differentiation. This is driven by loss of RNA m6A of transposable elements, triggering interferon-STAT signaling and activating luminal gene expression via STATâ€“GATA3 crosstalk.'
